# Feature Engineering on the Lakehouse

**Here is what you will learn as part of this chapter:**
1. Fast features with Structured Streaming
2. Writing features to the Databricks Feature Store
3. Building a training set with Feature Store features 

## Technical requirements 

**Here are the technical requirements needed to complete the hands-on examples in this chapter:**
1. We will create tables in the [Databricks Feature Store]((https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/feature-store/index.html)), a centralized repository of features for machine learning models. 
2. We will use the managed [volumes]((https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/language-manual/sql-ref-volumes.html)) to store the cleaned, featurized data making it ready for machine learning.
