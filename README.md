### What do you need to run the examples?

Each chapter folder contains code examples shared in the book using one of our data sources. You will need a Databricks environment and permissions to run a cluster in order to follow along. There is a [Databricks community Edition](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/community-edition.html) that you can use to run the provided notebooks and code.
