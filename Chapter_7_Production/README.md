# Productionizing Machine Learning

**Here is what you will learn as part of this chapter:**

1. Using the MLFlow Model Registries 
2. Executing with MLFlow Recipes
3. Automating the ML Lifecycle 
4. Model Inference & Model Serving

## Technical requirements 

**Here are the technical requirements needed to complete the hands-on examples in this chapter:**
1. On-demand features require the use of DBR ML 13.1 or higher.
2. [Python UDFs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/udf/unity-catalog.html) are created and governed in UC; hence, Unity Catalog must be enabled for the workspace.
