# Searching for Signal

**Here is what you will learn as part of this chapter:**
1. Baselining with AutoML
2. Tracking experiments with MLflow
3. Classifying beyond the basic
4. Integrating innovation

## Technical requirements 

**Here are the technical requirements needed to complete the hands-on examples in this chapter:**
1. In order to use the OpenAI API, you need to [set up a paid account](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview).
2. For our LLM model, we will integrate with the ChatGPT model from OpenAI. You will need an [API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and install the [OpenAI Python library](https://pypi.org/project/openai/)
3. We use the [SQLAlchemy Dialect](https://pypi.org/project/sqlalchemy-databricks/) for Databricks workspace and sql analytics clusters using the officially supported databricks-sql-connector dbapi.
